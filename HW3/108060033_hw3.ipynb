However, if you use the softmax and the cross entropy loss, that complexity fades away. Since the softmax layer is usually used at the output, we can actually calculate the derivative of the categorical cross-entropy loss with respect to the n-th node in the last hidden layer. Instead of a long clunky formula, you end up with this terse, easy to compute thing: $$\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial Z_i} = s_i - y_i $$, where $s$ is the output of the softmax function and the $y$ is the true label vector(one-hot vector). For more information, you can refer to this article [Derivative of the Softmax Function and the Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss](https://towardsdatascience.com/derivative-of-the-softmax-function-and-the-categorical-cross-entropy-loss-ffceefc081d1). <br> \n","❗**Important**❗: The above mathematical derivation is based on naive implementation.

Recall that when you implemented the `L_model_forward` function, at each iteration, you stored a cache which contains (X,W,b, and z). In the back propagation module, you will use those variables to compute the gradients. Therefore, in the `L_model_backward` function, you will iterate through all the hidden layers backward, starting from layer $L$. On each step, you will use the cached values for layer $l$ to backpropagate through layer $l$. Figure below shows the backward pass.\n","\n","<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amanchadha/coursera-deep-learning-specialization/6ebc4d60a90c1592aee3eaa3113eb4b37d9b4b19/C1%20-%20Neural%20Networks%20and%20Deep%20Learning/Week%204/Building%20your%20Deep%20Neural%20Network%20-%20Step%20by%20Step/images/mn_backward.png\" height=\"400\"/>\n","\n","Initializing backpropagation: To backpropagate through this network, we know that the output is, $A^{[L]} = \\sigma(Z^{[L]})$. Your code thus needs to compute dAL $= \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial A^{[L]}}$.

As seen in figure above, you can now feed in dAL into the LINEAR->SIGMOID backward function you implemented (which will use the cached values stored by the L_model_forward function). After that, you will have to use a for loop to iterate through all the other layers using the LINEAR->RELU backward function. You should store each dA, dW, and db in the grads dictionary.
